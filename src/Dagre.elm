drawing based on popular js library [dagrejs](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre).

This module assumes graphs are defined using elm-community/graph module.

1.  The width and height fields represent the width and height of graph.
2.  The coordDict contains the dictionary that maps node-ids to the coordinates
    on cartesian plane.
3.  The controlPtsDict contains a dictionary that maps edges to its control/bend points
    (list of node-ids)

   main function that returns the Dagre Layout
   Positions and Control Points for splines.
   This package implements Sugiyama style graph drawing.
   The Sugiyama framework has the following phases in order of execution
   1. Making Graph Acyclic (Removing cycles)
   2. Rank/Layer Assignment
   3. Normalizing (Removing Long Edges)
   4. Vertex Ordering (Reducing Number of Edge Crossing)
   5. Coordinate Assignment

{-| This is the main function that computes the layout for a graph using sugiyama
style graph drawing.

This function takes a list of Dagre Attributes and a graph and outputs the layout.

    -- simpleGraph = Graph from Readme (or any graph)
    runLayout [] simpleGraph

All the computed coordinates lie between (0,0) and (width,height).
In simple terms, you can set `viewBox 0 0 width height` in the svg.
